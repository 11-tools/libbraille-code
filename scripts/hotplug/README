README for the USB hotplug scripts for libbralle :
--------------------------------------------------

If you intend to use a USB Braille display with libusb and Linux, you
should install the hotplug package, and then take the following steps
:
  o Copy the libbraille.usermap and libusbbraille files from this
    directory to /etc/hotplug/usb/

  o Check if /etc/hotplug/usb/libbraille.usermap already knows about
    your Braille display. If your Braille display is not in this
    list,add a line similar to the other ones using the vendor ID and
    the product ID of your Braille display. Please contact the
    libbraille-misc mailing list in this case so the ids of your
    Braille display can be added.

  o Make sure that the "braille" group exists on your system and that
    every user who should be allowed to acces the Braille display is a
    member of that group.
    Alternatively, you can enable access for every user of your system in
    libusbbraille.

The vendor ID and product ID of your Braille display can be obtained
by running lsusb (you might need to run it as root).

If the hotplug support doesn't work for you once you have taken the steps
described above, check that your kernel has been built with hotplug support.
Otherwise, you'll need to rebuild your kernel.
