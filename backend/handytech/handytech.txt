Handy Tech driver
=================

This driver was written thanks to a Braille Wave 40 display at the
INSERM (Paris, France).

Warning: when the display is in sleep mode, it cannot be
autodetected. You should then press a key on it before to try the
autodetection.

Setting up the Braille Wave

To put the Braille Wave in PC mode :

1. Power on the Braille Wave
2. Click the key on the right of the display twice (the display shows
   "PC mode")
3. Click the key on the right of the space bar

Setting up the Vario in Handy Tech emulation mode

In order to use this driver you need to set your Vario to "Emulation Mode 2"
as follows:

1. Power on the Vario. It should print some status information,
   starting with the text "BAUM". Last in the display there should be
   information on which emulation-mode is in use, memorize this so
   you'll be able to change it back if necessary.
2. Change the emulation using the upper and lower buttons beside the
   display.  Depending on the firmware-version the Vario can have 2-5
   modes. The end of the display should read "Emul. 2". For some
   reason the dot-patterns doesn't seem to match real braille, so
   ignore the lower right dot in the number.
3. Save the setting by pressing the upper and lower button right or
   left beside the display simultaneously about 3 seconds. The display
   will then show "Saved".
