Backend for eurobraille terminals
=================================

This driver was created thanks to documentation provided by
eurobraille.

It was tested on an azerBRAILLE 4, a Scriba and an Iris from the
BrailleNet association.
It was tested on an CLIO euroBRAILLE 8 at the Cit√© des Sciences et de
L'Industrie de La Villette.

The iris can be put in PC mode by choosing (with cursor keys) the
"serial-PC" option at launch time (it is the third on the line after
starting the terminal).

The azerBraille is already in PC mode at launch time.

The Scriba can be put in PC mode by typing 'b' (dots 1 and 2) once the
terminal has been started.

The CLIO euroBRAILLE can be put in PC mode by pressing on the numeric
keypad the 'B' key then the '3' key.
